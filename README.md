# 💎 Autopilot Wallet  
### Built for BDAG | Powered by BlockDAG Network  

> Automate your BDAG airdrops — fast, secure, and effortless.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

**Autopilot Wallet** is a BDAG airdrop automation tool built for the **BlockDAG network**.  
It helps users and project owners send BDAG tokens to multiple wallet addresses instantly with just one click.  

---

## 🧠 Core Idea  

The goal of Autopilot Wallet is to simplify large BDAG distributions by:  
1. Connecting the user’s **MetaMask wallet**.  
2. Uploading a **CSV file** with wallet addresses and token amounts.  
3. Executing the **airdrop automatically** using BlockDAG’s fast parallel processing.  

Everything happens securely on-chain — your BDAG never leaves your wallet without confirmation.

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. **Connect Wallet** – User connects MetaMask and the app switches to the BDAG network.  
2. **Upload CSV** – The user uploads a file containing recipient addresses and BDAG amounts.  
3. **Preview & Confirm** – The app validates addresses, checks balances, and shows totals.  
4. **Execute Airdrop** – Tokens are sent in batch using BDAG’s parallel system.  
5. **Success Report** – A full transaction report is generated with links to BlockDAG Explorer.

## 🎥 Video Script

   Hi, I'm building Autopilot Wallet - the automated BDAG airdrop solution.
   
**Problem**: Distributing tokens to hundreds of wallets manually takes hours and risks errors.

**Solution**: One-click bulk airdrops with CSV upload, preview, and automated execution.

**Why BlockDAG?** Leveraging BDAG's parallel processing for faster, cheaper transactions.

**Vision**: Make token distribution as easy as sending an email.
